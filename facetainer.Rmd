The charts below track the following metrics for users with the Facebook Containers (`@contain-facebook`) extension in their environment, as observable from Telemetry:

* **DAU** (Daily Active Users): Count of distinct users on a given day
* **WAU** (Weekly Active Users): Count of distinct users in the last 7 days
* **MAU** (Monthly Active Users): Count of distinct users in the last 28 days

These counts are **not sampled** and reflect the true value for each channel. 

Note that Facebook Containers was launched on March 27, 2018; therefore WAU and MAU do not reflect their true values until 7 and 28 days **after** the launch date, respectively.
